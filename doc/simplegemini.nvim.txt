1. Features                                        *SimpleGeminiFeatures*

SimpleGemini plugin let you ask something to Google Gemini without leaving
NeoVim. The plugin is written in Lua and takes its inspiration from
askGemini.nvim. Contrary to other feature-rich plugins available on Github,
this one strives to avoid imposing a specific workflow on the user.

It only adds one new command and several Lua functions to your environment
(see also |SimpleGeminiCommands|). It does not create any new keymap. You have
to configure them by yourself.

The plugin does not rely on third-party plugins.

The plugin implementation is lazily loaded. There is no need to use the
package manager for a lazy loading of the plugin.

==============================================================================
2. Installation                                    *SimpleGeminiInstallation*

The plugin needs a Gemini API key to connect to the Gemini API. You have to
follow the instructions at https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey?hl=fr

Installation with lazy.nvim ~

If you use lazy.nvim as your package manager, you can install SimpleGemini.nvim
with the following specification.
>
 return {
    [...]
    {
	'frodonh/simplegemini.nvim',
	opts = {
	    [...]
	}
    }
    [...]
 }

==============================================================================
3. Configuration                                   *SimpleGeminiConfiguration*

A few configuration options are provided. They may be defined at startup (with
require 'SimpleGemini'.setup({options}) ). {options} is a table with the
configuration options.

api_key                  Gemini API key.
                         If not set in the options, the value from the
			 'GEMINI_API_KEY' environment variable is used.

model                    Gemini model name (default is 'gemini-2.0-flash').

==============================================================================
4. Commands                                        *SimpleGeminiCommands*

                                                        *:SimpleGemini*
:[range]SimpleGemini Buffer {prompt}
                         Ask a question to Gemini and insert answer
			 before cursor position in the current buffer. If 
			 specified, [prompt] is sent to Gemini.

			 If [range] is given, the prompt is followed by a
			 newline and all the lines in the range.

:[range]SimpleGemini! Buffer {prompt}
                         Ask a question to Gemini and insert answer
			 before cursor position in the current buffer. If 
			 specified, [prompt] is sent to Gemini.

			 If [range] is given, the prompt is followed by a
			 newline and all the lines in the range. Unlike
			 the previous plain version, the selection is deleted
			 before the answer is inserted.

			 In other words the selected text is used as the
			 prompt for a Gemini request, which may be preceded by
			 another prompt, and is replaced by its answer.

:[range]SimpleGemini Reg={name} {prompt}
                         Ask a question to Gemini and fill the {name}
			 register with the answer. If specified, {prompt} is 
			 sent to Gemini.

			 {name} should be a single character specifying the
			 buffer which will be filled with the answer of the
			 request to Gemini.
			 
			 If [range] is given, the prompt is followed by a
			 newline and all the lines in the range.

:[range]SimpleGemini Scratch [prompt]
                         Ask a question to Gemini and display the answer   
                         in a new floating window. If specified, {prompt}
			 is sent to Gemini.

			 The floating window can be closed by pressing <Esc>.
			 The content of the floating window is deleted when 
			 it is closed.

			 If [range] is given, the prompt is followed by a
			 newline and all the lines in the range.

5. Functions                                       *SimpleGeminiFunctions*

Functions are in the 'simplegemini' module. You have to require the module to
use them.

setup({options})                                     *SimpleGeminiSetup*
    Configure options for the plugin.

    Parameters: ~
      • {options}   Dictionary with options. See also
	            |SimpleGeminiConfiguration| for configuration parameters.


ask_gemini({args})                                   *SimpleGeminiAsk*
    Sumbit a prompt to the LLM.

    Parameters: ~
      • {args}      Dictionary of arguments. The table should have the same
	            structure as the {command} argument of the 
		    |nvim_create_user_command()| function (used to define new
		    commands).
		    Since this function matches the call protocol of commands,
		    it is suitable to defe new commands. It is for example
		    used by the |:SimpleGemini| command.
		    The following keys are used:
		    • args: (string) The prompt passed to the command, if any
		    • range: (number) The number of items in the range passed
		      to the function, 0 if no range was selected. If a range
		      was selected, it will be added to the prompt.
		    • line1: (number) The starting line of the command range
		    • line2: (number) The final line of the command range

    Return: ~
        Array of lines sent as answer by the LLM


create_scratch_with_lines({lines})                  *SimpleGeminiScratch*
    Create a new scratch window, centered on the screen, and display lines
    from the argument in the window. The window may be closed by pressing
    <Esc>.

    Parameters: ~
      • {lines}     Array of lines that should be displayed on the new scratch
	            window.
